# dynamic-depth-ambient-occlussion
-one where depth is easily distinguishable, which is the deepest buried point vs the most peaking  portruding point.
---most importantly on a still image 0000000000000000
----my eyes tend to revolve around and kept clicking on this artist images via pinterest without knowing it was the same artist : https://www.artstation.com/shitong
---highlighting the ridgeds with a dark gradient 
----so the depeeest most buried parts are dark and the ones peaking portruding the lightest even from a far distance the body parts portruding the most should be very obvious  as you get closer and closer the protrusion is more obvious so how do you capture this in 2d art ----how to give image depth by paintaing and adding highlihgts
